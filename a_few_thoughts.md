This document is intended to be in a constant state of flux. It will serve as a place for general thoughts as well as a place for simple reminders regarding new subjects that I am learning/projects that I wish to build.

## Current Hurdles
1. Having difficulty installing Ruby 2.0.0 and Rails 4
	* For the meantime, I will continue to experiment with Ruby 1.9.3 and Rails 3.
2. Trying to figure out whether or not I like using LESS or SASS.
	* I believe this would ultimately determine whether to use [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

## Current Projects
1. Currently working on a simple **to do app** built within the rails framework.
	* This would be the first app following Michael Hartl's sample app guide.
	* I believe this would run temporarily on Heroku.
	* By adding multiple users ... and the ability to group edit a document (similar to googledocs), it could quickly turn into a group planning tool for extended family vacations. 

## Future Ideas/Projects
1. I would like to build a **stat tracker** that I can use while I am watching my brother's baseball games.
	* Ideally this would be able to track balls, strikes, hits, runs, etc.
	* Imagining this could be good for when some part of the family is not able to watch a game, so they could get updates when they sign into their account.
2. Would like to build a **pinterest like gallery application**.
	* My school has a student run magazine and they accept submissions via email. This requires the editors to open each individual email, pull out the images, coordinate them into one doc and then begin the editing process.
	* I think it would be beneficial if users could submit images to a collection and then have that entire collection be nicely displayed in a grid so that the editors could all access the images regardless of what device they are on.
	* This would likely use Bootstrap or Foundation.
3. Would like to **3d-print flight paths** from a recent trip. 
	* This could serve as a fun abstract sculpture.
	* If it was correctly placed over the corresponding map, the 3d arcs would line up the locations of the airports!
